# Important Notes

- There are two copies of the Verismart benchmarks

  + The copy `verismart-origin` is the original benchmark, downloaded from the
    GitHub repository: https://github.com/kupl/VeriSmart-benchmarks/

  + The copy `verismart-updated` is the version where certain test cases are
    updated by Discover to ensure that compilation and testing with the test
    cases will be successful.


## Solidity Migration Status

We are currently upgrading the solidity source code in `benchmarks/verismart` to make it compile with solang. The `solang` (using `solana` as the compilation target) compilation status can be found in the followign files:

- `benchmarks/verismart/solang.verismart-updated.benchmarks.zeus.status.txt`
